# Basic Programming Practice Problems

This repository contains practice problems designed to help students learn the fundamentals of programming. These problems cover variables, basic data types, operators, and conditional logic. Each problem encourages students to apply what they've learned to solve programming challenges.

## Problems

Below are the practice problems along with code snippets to get you started. Try to solve them on your own first, then check the solutions branch for reference.

### 1. Hello Variable

**Instructions**: Declare a variable named `greeting` with the string value `"Hello, World!"` and print it.

```javascript
let greeting; // Assign "Hello, World!" to this variable and print it.
```

### 2. Basic Math

**Instructions**: Define two variables with integer values and calculate their sum, difference, product, and quotient.

```javascript
let num1, num2; // Assign integer values and perform arithmetic operations.
```

### 3. Swapping Values

**Instructions**: Swap the values of two variables without using a third variable.

```javascript
let a = 1,
  b = 2; // Swap these values without using a new variable.
```

### 4. Type Annotation (TypeScript)

**Instructions**: This applies to TypeScript. Create a string variable and try changing its type.

```typescript
let message: string; // Now try assigning a number to it and see what happens.
```

### 5. Modulus Operator

**Instructions**: Use the modulus operator to find the remainder of two numbers.

```javascript
let num1, num2; // Use the modulus operator (%) to find the remainder.
```

### 6. Increment Challenge

**Instructions**: Increment a variable's value by 1 using two different methods.

```javascript
let counter = 0; // Increment this value by 1 in two different ways.
```

### 7. Logical Gates

**Instructions**: Given three boolean variables, write expressions for AND, OR, and NOT gates.

```javascript
let a = true,
  b = false,
  c = true; // Write expressions using these.
```

### 8. Compound Assignment

**Instructions**: Show examples of using compound assignment operators.

```javascript
let num = 10; // Use +=, -=, *=, and /= on this variable.
```

### 9. Even or Odd

**Instructions**: Write a program to check if a number is even or odd.

```javascript
let num; // Determine if this is even or odd.
```

### 10. Voting Eligibility

**Instructions**: Check if a person is eligible to vote.

```javascript
let age; // Check if age is 18 or older to determine voting eligibility.
```

### 11. Grading System

**Instructions**: Assign a grade based on a numerical score.

```javascript
let score; // Use conditionals to assign and print grades A, B, C, D, or F.
```

### 12. Max of Three

**Instructions**: Find the maximum of three numbers.

```javascript
let x, y, z; // Determine the largest among these.
```

### 13. Leap Year Checker

**Instructions**: Check if a given year is a leap year.

```javascript
let year; // Determine if this is a leap year.
```

### 14. Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter

**Instructions**: Write a program that converts temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius.

```javascript
let fahrenheit; // Convert this to Celsius and print the result.
```

### 15. Positive, Negative, or Zero

**Instructions**: Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

```javascript
let number; // Determine the sign of this number.
```

### 16. Multiplication Table

**Instructions**: Write a program that prints the multiplication table of a given number up to 10.

```javascript
let number; // Print the multiplication table for this number up to 10.
```
