# Typescript Fundamentals Assignment

## Overview

This assignment is designed to test your understanding of TypeScript fundamentals covered in the topics of console logging, variables, data types, operators, conditional statements, functions, arrays, array methods, and loops. You will apply your knowledge through a series of practical, problem-solving questions that range from easy to challenging.

## Objectives

- Understand and implement basic TypeScript operations.
- Develop functions for specific tasks.
- Manipulate arrays using various methods.
- Solve problems using Typescript code.

## Instructions

- Answer each question by writing the appropriate Typescript code.
- Test your code to ensure it meets the specifications given in each question.
- Comment your code where necessary to explain your logic.

## Questions

### Easy

1. Write a script to log "Hello, World!" to the console.
2. Create a variable `temperature` and assign it a value. Then log "It's cold!" if the temperature is below 20 degrees Celsius.
3. Use arithmetic operators to solve the problem: If you have 10 apples and you give away 3, how many do you have left? Log the result.
4. Declare two variables, `firstName` and `lastName`, then create a third variable `fullName` that combines them. Log the result.
5. Write a TypeScript code that uses a comparison operator to check if the number 5 is greater than 3. Log "Yes" if true, otherwise log "No".

### Medium

6. Create a function `calculateArea` that takes the radius of a circle as an input and returns the area of the circle.
7. Write a loop that logs numbers from 1 to 50. For multiples of 3, log "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, log "Buzz".
8. Define an array `temperatures` with at least five different temperatures (numbers). Write a script to find and log the highest temperature.
9. Create a script that prompts the user to enter their age and then logs whether they are a minor (under 18) or an adult.
10. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the count of positive numbers in the array.

### Arrays and Array Methods

11. Write a function that takes an array of words and returns a new array containing only the words that start with the letter 'a'.
12. Create a script that logs the second to last element of an array named `fruits`.
13. Develop a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array with each number squared.
14. Write a JavaScript function that accepts an array and reverses its elements without using the `.reverse()` method. Log the result.
15. Given an array `scores` [10, 5, 20, 20, 4, 5, 2, 25, 1], write a function that logs the number of times the score exceeded the maximum score and the number of times it fell below the minimum score.
16. Create a function that removes all falsey values from an array. Falsey values include `false`, `null`, `0`, `""`, `undefined`, and `NaN`.
17. Write a script that concatenates two arrays `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]` into a single array.
18. Develop a function called `sumOfElements` that calculates the sum of all elements in an array that are either even or odd, based on a parameter.
19. Create a function that checks whether an element exists in an array. If it exists, return the index, otherwise return -1.
20. Write a function to find and return the smallest number in an array of integers.

### Functions

21. Write a function `calculateProduct` that takes an array of numbers and returns the product of all elements.
22. Develop a function `filterByLength` that takes an array of strings and a number `n`. The function should return an array containing only the strings that are longer than `n` characters.
23. Create a function `findDuplicates` that finds and logs all duplicates in an array.
24. Write a function `incrementAll` that takes an array of integers and increments each element by one.
25. Develop a function `countOccurrences` that counts how many times a specific element appears in an array.
26. Create a function `isSorted` that checks if an array is sorted in ascending order.
27. Write a function that receives an array of names and formats them into a string separated by commas, except for the last two names, which should be separated by "and".
28. Develop a function that converts an array of Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius and logs the new temperatures.
29. Write a function `minMaxAverage` that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with properties for the minimum, maximum, and average of those numbers.
30. Create a function `swapElements` that swaps two specified indices in an array.

### Hard

31. Develop a function that takes two inputs, a string and a character, and returns the number of times the character appears in the string.
32. Create a 'to-do list' array of objects where each object has properties `task` and `completed` (a boolean). Write a function to log only the tasks that are not yet completed.
33. Write a function that takes an array of integers and sorts them from smallest to largest.
34. Develop a TypeScript program that logs every element of an array in reverse order without using the `.reverse()` method.
35. Write a script that simulates a basic calculator. It should take two operands and an operator ('+', '-', '\*', '/') from the user, perform the operation, and log the result.
